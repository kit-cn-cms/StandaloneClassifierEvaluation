set up CMSSW_7_4_15
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/
git clone https://github.com/cms-ttH/CommonClassifier.git
and setup up MEM part with https://github.com/cms-ttH/CommonClassifier/blob/master/setup/install_mem.sh

scram b 

You now have an executable in $CMSSW_BASE/test/*/standaloneClassifier

Use $CMSSW_BASE/src/StandaloneClassifierEvaluation/Classifier/test/sendJobs.py with:
- our NTuple trees as input 
- an output directory

Will write BDT in/outputs & MEM outputs to new Trees

Possible bug:
I experienced problems with the MEM code not being able to open some needed files.
To fix copy https://github.com/cms-ttH/CommonClassifier/tree/master/root to different location 
and change https://github.com/cms-ttH/CommonClassifier/blob/master/src/MEMClassifier.cc accordingly.
