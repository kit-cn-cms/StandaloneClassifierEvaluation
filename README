set up CMSSW_7_4_15
git clone https://github.com/cms-ttH/CommonClassifier.git
and setup up MEM part with https://github.com/cms-ttH/CommonClassifier/blob/master/setup/install_mem.sh
!!! But care type on line 9 !!!

For now:
git clone https://github.com/kit-cn-cms/TTH.git

-> both packages should end up in $CMSSW_BASE/src/TTH/

scram b 

You now have an executable in $CMSSW_BASE/test/*/standaloneClassifier

Use $CMSSW_BASE/src/StandaloneClassifierEvaluation/Classifier/test/sendJobs.py with:
- our NTuple trees as input 
- an output directory

Will write BDT in/outputs & MEM outputs to new Trees

Possible bug:
I experiences problems with the MEM code not able to open needed files.
To fix copy https://github.com/cms-ttH/CommonClassifier/tree/master/root to different location 
and change https://github.com/cms-ttH/CommonClassifier/blob/master/src/MEMClassifier.cc accordingly.
